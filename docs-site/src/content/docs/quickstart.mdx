description: From “pip install” to your first cached wish.
---

## 1) Install wishful

Add wishful to your project like any other library:

```bash
pip install wishful
```

wishful targets Python 3.12+. It uses [`litellm`](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm),
so any provider it supports will work here too.

## 2) Point it at an LLM

Configure your provider with the usual environment variables. For example, with OpenAI:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=...
export DEFAULT_MODEL=gpt-4.1
```

Or with Azure OpenAI:

```bash
export AZURE_API_KEY=...
export AZURE_API_BASE=https://<your-endpoint>.openai.azure.com/
export AZURE_API_VERSION=2025-04-01-preview
export DEFAULT_MODEL=azure/gpt-4.1
```

You can also set `WISHFUL_MODEL` instead of `DEFAULT_MODEL` if you prefer.

## 3) Your first wish

Drop this into a scratch file or a REPL:

```python
from wishful.static.text import extract_emails

raw = "Contact us at team@example.com or sales@demo.dev"
print(extract_emails(raw))
```

Run it once.

If you open the new `.wishful/text.py` file, you&apos;ll see real Python code that wishful
generated, validated and cached for you.

**A‑ha moment:** the function you imported didn&apos;t exist anywhere in your repo — the import
itself was the spec. You just wished it into existence. 🪄

## 4) Optional: fake LLM mode

_For when you want the magic but your Wi-Fi doesn't._

For CI, demos, or offline experiments, flip on stubbed generation:

```bash
export WISHFUL_FAKE_LLM=1
python your_script.py
```

In fake mode, wishful returns deterministic stub implementations instead of
calling a real model. The test suite uses this mode; your project can too.
