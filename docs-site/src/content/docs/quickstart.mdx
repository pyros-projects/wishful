## 1) Prereqs

- Python 3.12+
- Node 18+ (only if you’re building this doc site; not needed to use wishful)
- `uv` installed globally (`curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh`)

## 2) Sync the project

```bash
uv sync
```

This installs the runtime + dev dependencies into `.venv` based on `uv.lock`.

## 3) Your first wish

```bash
uv run python - <<'PY'
import wishful

# Use the fake LLM so this runs offline/deterministically
import os
os.environ["WISHFUL_FAKE_LLM"] = "1"

from wishful.static.text import meaning_of_life

print("The meaning is:", meaning_of_life())
PY
```

What happens:
- `wishful` installs its import hook.
- The first import triggers generation; in fake mode you get a stub that returns inputs (or a friendly constant).
- The generated module is cached under `.wishful/`.

## 4) Run the test suite

```bash
uv run pytest
```

All tests are network-free by design.

## 5) Clean up

```bash
uv run python - <<'PY'
import wishful
wishful.clear_cache()
print(wishful.inspect_cache())  # should be empty
PY
```
