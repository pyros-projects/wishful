### Ground rules (short version)

- Use `uv` for everything Python. No raw `pip`, no bare `python`/`pytest` in this repo.
- Python ≥ 3.12; dependencies locked in `uv.lock`.
- Tests are the contract. Run `uv run pytest` before/after changes.
- Safety rules matter; don’t weaken them without updating docs + tests.

### Dev loop

```bash
uv sync
uv run pytest              # or a focused file
```

When touching docs:

```bash
cd docs-site
npm install
npm run dev   # or npm run build
```

### Handy references

- `AGENTS.md` — house style, architecture, and “don’t step on that rake” notes.
- `examples/` — progressively weirder demos.
- `tests/` — best source of truth for expected behavior.

### Philosophical note

wishful isn’t a hardened enterprise core lib (yet). Keep the tone playful, the code safe, and the UX frictionless. If a change isn’t fun to explain, maybe it isn’t ready.
